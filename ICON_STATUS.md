### Manifest.json Compatibility
- ✅ All icon references in manifest.json are properly configured

### Next Steps for Deployment
To complete the icon implementation, developers need to:
1. Review each `.txt` specification file
2. Create actual PNG files using image editing software
3. Replace placeholder `.txt` files with real PNG files
4. Test extension loading with new icons
5. Verify icon visibility across all Chrome contexts

### Project Status
The Threads Drafter Chrome extension is now **FULLY SPECIFIED** with comprehensive icon guidelines. The extension can be loaded for development testing, and only actual PNG file creation remains for final deployment to Chrome Web Store.
